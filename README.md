# Backend Environment

▸ Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that
provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
APIs:
▸ With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal,
creating a robust API is quick and easy.
Performance:
▸ Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features,
without obscuring Node.js features.
You will rarely see a tutorial using Node for Web development without Express. I
would be doing you a disservice to not use it. However, remember Node is NOT
just used for Web Development!! I could teach a whole course on Node itself.
